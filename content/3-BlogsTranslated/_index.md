This section will list and introduce the blogs you have translated. For example:

###  [Blog 1 - Develop and monitor a Spark application using existing data in Amazon S3 with Amazon SageMaker Unified Studio](3.1-Blog1/)
This blog explains how to develop and monitor Spark applications in the integrated environment of Amazon SageMaker Unified Studio. You will learn how to address challenges in managing big data analytics, such as fragmented development environments, complex resource management, and inconsistent monitoring. The article details how to set up Serverless EMR, develop Spark applications with the TPC-DS dataset in Jupyter notebooks, monitor performance using the Spark UI, and automate workflows with Amazon MWAA. This unified solution helps data teams focus on analytics instead of managing infrastructure.
###  [Blog 2 -Democratize data for timely decisions with text-to-SQL at Parcel Perform](3.2-Blog2/)
This blog explains how Parcel Perform uses generative AI and modern architecture to help operations teams query data quickly without relying on technical teams. It covers how to build a data lake to process billions of shipping event records per day, and how to use text-to-SQL and RAG workflows to automatically translate user questions into precise SQL queries.

###  [Blog 3 -Build a scalable AI video generator using Amazon SageMaker AI and CogVideoX](3.3-Blog3/)
This blog introduces how to build a scalable AI video generation system using Amazon SageMaker AI and the CogVideoX model.
