>Here, I would like to share my most sincere feelings about the internship experience at AWS Vietnam, hoping this feedback can help the FCJ team and future generations of interns have better experiences.

### General Assessment

**1. Working Environment** The working environment at AWS Vietnam is truly impressive and professional. The modern office at Bitexco Financial Tower creates a sense of pride when working here. FCJ team members are always ready to assist when I encounter difficulties, even outside working hours. The workspace is tidy and comfortable, helping me focus better. The atmosphere is dynamic but not stressful, allowing me to maximize my abilities.

**2. Mentor / Admin Team Support** The mentor provided very detailed guidance, explained clearly when I didn't understand, and always encouraged me to ask questions. The admin team supported procedures, documentation, and created favorable conditions for my work. I highly appreciate that the mentor allowed me to try and solve problems by myself instead of just providing the answers.

**3. Suitability of Work to Academic Major** The tasks I was assigned were suitable for the knowledge I learned at university, while also broadening my exposure to new areas I had not yet accessed. As a result, I both consolidated my foundational knowledge and learned practical skills.

**4. Learning Opportunities & Skill Development** This is the point I appreciate the most. I not only learned technical skills but also developed professional skills, teamwork skills, and professional communication in a corporate environment. Mr. Hoang Van Kha also shared a lot of practical experience, helping me better orient my career path.

**5. Culture & Team Spirit** The company culture is very positive: everyone respects each other, works seriously but with joy. When there's an urgent project, everyone works together, providing support regardless of position. This made me feel like I was a part of the collective, even as just an intern.

**6. Intern Policies / Benefits** The company provided internship allowance and offered flexibility in working hours when necessary. FCJ members were always ready to answer student questions, even outside of working hours. Furthermore, being able to participate in training workshops was a major plus.

### Other Questions

- What did you **enjoy most** during your internship? 

    - The thing that made me most satisfied and fond of the experience was the **supportive spirit and professional discipline** of all the seniors in the FCJ team. Whenever I faced challenges, I received dedicated guidance, which helped me feel more confident and stable in my work.
- What do you think the company **needs to improve** for subsequent interns? 

    - To help future interns feel more connected and close to each other, as well as to the company culture, I hope the company can enhance networking activities. Specifically, I propose: **Organizing meetups for the members within our team** so everyone has the opportunity to socialize, get acquainted, and work together more easily. Additionally, if there were more **In-depth Training sessions on specific professional areas**, it would be very beneficial for our career development orientation.
- If recommending to friends, would you **advise them to intern here**? Why? 

    - **Absolutely YES!** I would recommend it immediately. This is an ideal working environment: professional yet incredibly welcoming, with dedicated mentors, and clear work, suitable for developing comprehensive skills, from specialized knowledge to professional conduct.

### Proposals & Wishes

- Do you have any proposals to improve the internship experience? 

    - I propose focusing on community building and networking, specifically:

        * **Increasing in-person meetups at the office:** As I suggested, small team gatherings would help everyone feel closer, more bonded, and gain a clearer understanding of the company culture and the work itself.

        * **Organizing additional experience sharing sessions** or internal knowledge sharing among different departments to broaden the interns' knowledge and perspective.
- Would you like to continue this program in the future?

    - I am very **eager** to continue participating in this program or other company projects in the future, as I truly found a positive working environment and a great opportunity for self-development here.
