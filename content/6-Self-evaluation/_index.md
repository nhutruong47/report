Throughout my internship at **AMAZON WEB SERVICES VIETNAM COMPANY LIMITED** from **09/09/2025** to **13/12/2025**, I had the valuable opportunity to learn, develop, and apply theoretical knowledge acquired at university to a real professional work environment.

During the internship, I actively participated in **developing an intelligent AI chatbot project using advanced AWS services such as Amazon Bedrock, Lambda Functions, S3, and API Gateway**, thereby not only enhancing my skills in **proficient use of AWS cloud services, developing Python and JavaScript programming skills, improving effective teamwork capabilities, and learning to apply AI/ML to real-world solutions**.

Regarding work attitude, I always maintained a positive mindset, proactively completed assigned tasks with excellence, strictly adhered to company regulations, and was proactive in exchanging ideas and learning from colleagues as well as mentors to continuously improve work efficiency and output quality.

To reflect the most objective and honest assessment of my internship process, I would like to evaluate myself based on the following professional criteria:
